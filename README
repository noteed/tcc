Haskell bindings to the Tiny C Compiler library (libtcc).

The Cabal file builds against libtcc.so but the source
distribution file doesn't provide one. To create it,
instead of
 > ./configure
 > make
 > make install
use for instance
 > ./configure --extra-cflags="-fPIC"
 > make
 > gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libtcc.so -o libtcc.so libtcc.o
 > make install
 > cp libtcc.so /usr/lib/
