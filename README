Haskell bindings to the Tiny C Compiler library (libtcc).

To use the bindings in ghci, it is necessary to have the
.so version of libtcc. But the source distribution of
TCC doesn't provide one.


When building TCC, instead of

 > ./configure
 > make
 > make install

you can use for instance

 > ./configure --extra-cflags="-fPIC"
 > make
 > gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libtcc.so -o libtcc.so libtcc.o
 > make install
 > cp libtcc.so /usr/lib/
